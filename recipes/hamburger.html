    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>If you are from the Chicago area, you have heard of White Castle® hamburgers. I believe down south they are Krystal®. This is the closest I have come to the real deal. Serve each with American cheese, dill pickle slices, and Dusseldorf mustard. Enjoy!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ½ pounds ground chuck</li>
        <li>⅓ cup plain bread crumbs</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>1 (1 ounce) package dry onion soup mix</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons water</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>24 small square dinner rolls</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). </li>       
        <li>Combine ground chuck, bread crumbs, egg, onion soup mix, water, and black pepper in a bowl; press into a 10x15-inch jelly roll pan. Prick holes through the chuck mixture for ventilation while cooking. </li>   
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until browned and cooked through, about 10 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). Drain excess grease. </li>   
        <li>Cut chuck mixture into squares the size of the rolls. Place 1 chuck patty in each roll.</li>   
    </ol>
